## Repository Focus
- `techstack-enforcer` is a formally verified technology stack enforcement system written in Ada/SPARK.
- This is a Rhodium Standard Repository; obey RSR policies, maintain `.bot_directives`, and keep `.machine_readable/` authoritative.
- The primary language is Ada/SPARK — all core enforcement logic MUST use SPARK_Mode.
- Prefer to keep generated files out of source control, and regenerate them with the documented commands before committing.

## Critical Invariants
- Core engine (src/core/) MUST be SPARK_Mode — no unsafe Ada in enforcement logic.
- Multi-layer blocking: never remove a blocking layer without adding a replacement.
- Learning mode MUST NOT block — it is observe-only by design.
- Lockdown mode MUST block on ALL violations including Warn level.
- All enforcement decisions MUST flow through the formally verified core.

## Workflow
1. Inspect `.machine_readable/STATE.scm` for blockers and next actions.
2. Respect any constraints listed inside `.machine_readable/AGENTIC.scm` when tooling changes are requested.
3. Build with `gprbuild -P techstack_enforcer.gpr -XMODE=debug`.
4. Verify with `gnatprove -P techstack_enforcer.gpr --level=2`.
5. After finishing edits, update STATE with your outcomes and commit with a concise, imperative message.

## Delivery Promises
- Mention in summaries whether STATE, `contractiles/`, or `.bot_directives/` changed.
- Keep this file in sync with the repository's status; update it if the governance changes.
